	 * number of stacks, but we can only rearrange the poles according to
	 * certain criteria:
	 * 
	 * 1. Poles can only be moved from higher altitudes to lower altitudes.
	 * 
	 * 2. Stacks can only be formed at the initial pole altitudes.
	 * 
	 * 3. A stack can consist of at least one pole.
	 * 
	 * Moving the poles down the mountain also costs money. Moving a pole with
	 * weight w and altitude x1 to an altitude x2 of where (x1 > x2)  costs w * (x1 - x2)  .
	 * 
	 * Determine the least amount of money needed to rearrange the poles into stacks.
