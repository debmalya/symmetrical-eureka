 * Build a search engine to help users to find destinations around the world

 * passions like 'Surfing', 'Shark Diving', 'Culture' and should recommend a
 * list of destinations that match those passions.
 * 
 * To implement such search engine we need to have a database , destination,
 * passions, endorsement count. How would implement such search engine?
 * 
 * What is the best way to do a combined search ? (e.g. If user search for
 * Architecture, Wine what is the best way to combine those two?) Is summing
 * them enough? Are you familiar with 'popularity bias' effect? How you overcome
 * that? How your search engine will consider those hidden gems and show them as
 * part or your result?
 * 
 * Some travelers endorse with some jokes. How do you ignore those?
 * What else you need to think about to make search engine results relevant to the users?
