 *         You are given an undirected tree. The tree has n vertices, numbered 0
 *         through n-1. For each valid i, there is an edge between the vertices
 *         p[i] and (i+1). Each vertex i has a nonnegative integer weight x[i].
 * 
 *         All nonempty connected subgraphs of our tree are called its subtrees.
 *         The value of a subtree is the bitwise OR of the weights of its
 *         vertices. For example, a subtree that contains vertices with weights
 *         1, 4, and 6 has the value (1 OR 4 OR 6) = 7.
 * 
 *         You are given the description of the tree: the s p and x. Compute and
 *         return the sum of values of all subtrees, modulo 10^9 + 7.
