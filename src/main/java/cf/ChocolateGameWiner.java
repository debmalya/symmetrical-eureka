 * Chocolate Game is played between two players. The game starts once one of the

 * On each turn one of them eats either 1 Ã— 1 or 2 Ã— 2 piece from the chocolate
 * (whatever he chooses). The one who eats the last piece is known as the looser
 * of the game.
 * 
 * You are given the number n. Will the first player to make the turn win
 * assuming that both players play optimally? Here "play optimally" means they
 * make the optimal move to win, not to each as much chocolate as possible.
